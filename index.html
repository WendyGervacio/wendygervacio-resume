I love spending quality time with my family and hanging out with my friends. In my free time, I like going on walks, baking, reading books or just catching up and watching netflix. A few artists I like to listen to are Bad Bunny, The Marias, Harry styles, The Weeknd, etc.">

        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently majoring in the education field in hopes of becoming a teacher at UCR as an undergraduate. I chose to go into this field because throughout my school experience, I have had great teachers make an impact on my life. Many of those previous teachers I have had in my school experience, have inspired me to become a teacher just like them. The encouragement and hope they had  in me is what I admire about them and I would love to continue that. So when I become a teacher, I would like to make a great impact on my students' lives and encourage them to do their best by communicating with them, get to know them, converse with them about their goals and give them advice on how to succeed in life and letting them know they can always count on me.
<br><br>

        In 2022, I was awarded the Riverside County Seal of Multiliteracy, which is a recognition of high levels of attained proficiency in English and at least one other world language by high school graduation. The reason I got this award is because I took AP Spanish in my junior year of high school and passed the AP Spanish Language and Culture Exam. It is very beneficial that I have the Seal of Multiliteracy because anywhere I volunteer or any of the jobs I apply to, will see and  know I am classified as bilingual in English and Spanish.<br><br>

        I donâ€™t have much job experience but I was in a few clubs like ASB, AVID, and Journalism. In ASB, we mainly focus on leadership. We would plan school events, decorate events, plan out spirit days and themes,  encourage the faculty and students, etc. Even though I had only joined my senior year, it was a great experience for me because I was able to get more involved in my school and meet new people. In AVID, we mainly focused on preparing for college and building up the skills needed for the future. I enjoyed AVID because it gave me a perspective of what college would be like. Avid would make us do community service to get at least 24 hours by the end of the year each year. So as an experience, I would help out in elementary schools, mentor students, and create a bond with them. Being a part of AVID all my four years of high school, I was able to identify what college would be like, which one would be the most beneficial for me to attend, and apply all the skills I learned in AVID to college. In Journalism, we mainly focused on the news. I really enjoyed this class because I would not really pay much attention to the news before, but being in this class intrigued me to watch and analyze the news. We would talk about real world problems and what was going on in the news. As well as getting to know what type of events the school would do, since at the time I was in that class it was all during quarantine and COVID-19 time. Overall it was a great experience being in that class, but I wasnâ€™t able to meet anyone since it was in my junior year of high school and it was all through distance learning. So because of that there was not that much of a communication within my peers and I but we managed to make it work sometimes.
